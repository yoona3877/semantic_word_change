# semantic_word_change
This is a lab assignment of CSC2611: Semantic Word Change course. 

The code for the two questions in the assignment is in word2veclab.ipynb. 
At the time of implementing the code, my local server had missing library issue that wasn't able to solve. 
So the code is based on google colab, which may cause some discrepancy when opening up files. 

The necessary components and results are already in word2veclab notebook. If you want to run the notebook by yourself, please download all the necessary files on your local machine and change the path variables of the files in the notebook. 

Google word2vec are avilable: https://code.google.com/ archive/p/word2vec/
